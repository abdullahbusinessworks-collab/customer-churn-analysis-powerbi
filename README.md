# Customer Churn Analysis â€” Power BI

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This is my first Power BI project, simulating a real-world business case where a company 
wants to understand why customers are leaving, how churn affects revenue, and which regions 
or demographics are most impacted.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)
- SQL (data preparation background)
- Python (analytics background)

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets
- `Customer.xlsx` â†’ demographics, sign-up data
- `Transactions.xlsx` â†’ revenue history
- `Support.xlsx` â†’ support tickets & resolution time
- `Date.xlsx` â†’ calendar for time intelligence

## ðŸ“Š Features of the Dashboard
- Cleaned & transformed raw data using Power Query
- Designed relationships between Customer, Transactions, and Support tables
- Created DAX measures:
  - Total Revenue
  - Churned Customer Count
  - Active Customer Count
  - Churn Rate (%)
  - Revenue per Customer
  - YTD Sales
- Built interactive visuals:
  - Revenue by Region (Column chart)
  - Revenue Trend (Line chart)
  - Revenue Share by Gender/Product (Pie chart)
  - KPIs (Cards: Revenue, Churn Rate)
  - Slicers (Region, Churn status, Date)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- East region has the highest churn rate, especially in Q2.
